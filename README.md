# odin-recipes

## Hello!

This simple project was made following along with the HTML foundations lesson in The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

The purpose of this project was to get practice with:

1. HTML basics: 
    -displaying text in various ways (ordered and unordered lists, headings, paragraphs, etc.)
    -using anchor elements with absolute and relative links
    -adding images in html and writing alt text according to HTML Standard guidelines (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#alt)
2. Git and GitHub: 
    -using Git in the command line
    -making, moving, and deleting directories and files
    -working with a local repository and a remote repo on GitHub using an SSH key 
    -publishing the project using GitHub pages 
    -writing concise git commit messages and committing after fewer changes for better log history 

Thanks for taking a look!
