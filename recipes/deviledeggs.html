    <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>12 large eggs</li>
    
        <li>4 slices of bacon</li>
    
        <li>1/2 cup mayo</li>

        <li>2 tbsp cheddar cheese, grated</li>

        <li>1 tbsp mustard</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>

    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Hard boil the eggs: put eggs in a pot of cold water on the stove. Bring water to a boil, then remove from heat. Cover the pan and leave the eggs in the water for 10-12 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>While eggs are cooking, cook bacon in a large pan on medium-high heat. Turn occasionally to brown evenly. Cook for about 10 minutes, then place on a paper towel-lined plate and crumble into pieces.</li>
        
        <li>When eggs are done: dump the hot water and rinse eggs under cool water</li>
        
        <li>Peel the eggs and cut in half. Remove the yolks into a bowl.</li>
        
        <li>Add bacon, cheese, mustard and mayo to bowl and mash up. Spoon topping back into the egg halves.</li>

        <li>Eat up!</li>
    </ol>
