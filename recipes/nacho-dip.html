    <h4>Really easy dip for when you want a hearty meal but don't have the time or energy to make it.</h4>

    <p>
        My mom used to make this sometimes. It is nostalgic for me. She didn't use any particular recipe, so consider these basic guidelines. Feel free to add more ingredients to spice it up a bit.
        <br>
        Also be careful not to have the oven too hot when you are melting the cheese. I initially tried it at 450 but the cream cheese at the top burnt to the pan. Check on your dip after the first five minutes to make sure that isn't happening.
