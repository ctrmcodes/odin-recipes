    <h4>Really easy dip for when you want a hearty meal but don't have the time or energy to make it. Image from <a href="https://howtonestforless.com/3-ingredient-chili-cheese-dip/">howtonestforless</a>.</h4>

    <p>
        My mom used to make this sometimes. It is nostalgic for me. She didn't use any particular recipe, so consider these basic guidelines. Feel free to add more ingredients to spice it up a bit.
        <br>
        Also be careful not to have the oven too hot when you are melting the cheese. I initially tried it at 450 but the cream cheese at the top burnt to the pan. Check on your dip after the first five minutes to make sure that isn't happening.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 package of full-fat cream cheese</li>
    
        <li>2 cans of chili (I used Stagg vegetarian chili or spicy chili)</li>
    
        <li>Grated cheese (I grated marble cheese)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        
        <li>Spread your package of cream cheese out on the bottom of an oven-safe dish.</li>
        
        <li>Open both cans of chili and spread evenly over top of the cream cheese.</li>
        
        <li>Spread grated cheese over top of the chili.</li>

        <li>Place dip in the oven. Heat until all the cheese has completely melted together.</li>
        
        <li>Remove from oven. Allow to cool for a few minutes to avoid burning your tongue. Serve while still hot with tortilla chips.</li>
    </ol>
